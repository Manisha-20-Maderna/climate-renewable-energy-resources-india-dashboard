Climate Change & Renewable Energy Resources in India 🌞🌬️🌱

This project analyzes climate conditions and renewable energy generation across Indian states from **2019 to 2023** using data preprocessing in Python and interactive dashboards in Tableau.

---

 📊 Key Insights (2019–2023)
- **Gujarat** is consistently the top wind energy producer.
- **Rajasthan** leads in solar energy generation across all years.
- **Chhattisgarh** and **Punjab** are major contributors to biomass energy.
- **Himachal Pradesh (HP)** records the lowest atmospheric pressure throughout.
- Solar energy trends show monthly and yearly increases over time.

---

 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – For merging & preparing datasets
- **Tableau** – For interactive dashboard visualizations
- **Excel** – As the original data format
